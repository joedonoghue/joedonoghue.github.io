                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        My name is Joe Donoghue and I'm interested in all things tech- from designing websites to building quadcopters. You'll usually find me working on the computer or going for a run. My main interest lies in full-stack web development, though a lot of subjects catch my eye. <strong>My goal is to work as a Cyber Capabilities Development Officer, a software developer working for the Army Cyber Command or the Army Futures Command</strong>. <a href="mailto:j.donoghue@tcu.edu">j.donoghue@tcu.edu</a>.

                                This web application served to keep track of requirements that new members of the Beta Theta Pi Chapter at TCU needed to complete. It includes study hour location tracking, GPA tracking, quiz grade tracking, file dropboxes, real-time presentable status updates for team meetings, and submission checking/approval. New members submitted hundreds of photos and documents to an easy-to-use admin dashboard for team members to review.

                                This project involves projecting three differently-sized and seeded layers of Perlin noise on a 3D plane. A larger layer mimics the broad-shaped waves in the ocean or large hills and mountains. A second layer is for smaller details that create randomness and do away with a totally smooth wave or cliffside. The final layer is for fine detail like ripples in the water or a grainy/sandy land texture. Using a combination of parameters for these layers like amplitude and rate of change as well as color variations, you can come up with some cool looking ocean waves or terrain features.                                </div>
